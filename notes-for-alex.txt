* We should have a back button.  It does not need to interact with validation.  I stuck a sample back button on the first page where it obviously doesn't belong just so you will have styles.
* Validation does not work on "Your product review."  Maybe because it is a textarea instead of field?  It does work if you enter text and then delete it.  Actually, if you enter text and delete it, it will give the error.  The review title text, on the other hand, does not display an error if you delete it.  Even if the form things the review text field is invalid, it will let you go to the next page.  Buggy.
* The "complete" class is not getting removed when you clear a fieldset that contains checkboxes.
* The NPS slider does not make the fieldset "Complete". 
* I added "Oops! At least one required field has been skipped" to each section.  This will need to be displayed conditionally.  It shows up upon clicking the form button; it disappears when the invalid field is corrected.
* Our traditional form auto-populates all fields for which we have values.  This includes location, context data values, and email address.  We should figure out how to do that.  If you're concerned about privacy issues regarding email, let's at least not display that field if we know their email address already.
* If we know the person's nickname, we need to auto-populate the nickname field and disable it.  Why?  We don't allow nickname editing in Review submission.
* Inline styles trump external styles and are hard to detect.  Avoid.
* We will need to get Angel Tsang to QA this for us on the browsers they support.
* I'll talk to Dave about doing user tests so we can do some qualitative interviewing.
* Slider needs that touch plugin to be mobile-friendly
* formtesting/  is 4MB!  That's nuts!
* Android: every click has at least a half second latency. Scroll is jaggedy.  On iPad there's no problem, but clearly form is eating up more processing power than an Android is cool with.  Don't have iPhone on me.
* I added "hack" to paged.js so that the buttons always result in the user starting at the top of the page. Unfortunately, it doesn't really work for Android.  It doesn't take 'em all the way to the top.  =/
* Transfered all styles from .less to .css.  Deleted all the .less stuff.
* What is the difference between the "focus" and "active" classes?  Can we have "focus" actually mean focus in that when you click off the fieldset the focus goes away?
* Their "How do you prefer to shop" question has the dumbest answers: store, computer, mobile, all.  All?  They are checkboxes.  You can check "all" if you mean "all".  It's really hard to interpret "Mobile, All" in spreadsheets.  Let's change the phrasing on our form to: "At the store", "On my computer," "On my phone", and "On my tablet."  We're hijacking "All" to mean "Tablet" now, but we'll be able to separate those out using the Campaign ID.
